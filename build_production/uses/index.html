        <h1>Office setup, Applications, and More</h1>
<p>I have noticed a trend of other developers and designers of the sorts showcasing and providing what they use on their website. Inspired by them, and checking them all out on this awesome list by <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesbros Awesome-Uses</a>; I figured why not join the bandwagon and show off my everyday uses, and office setup.</p>
<p>My setup is pretty simple, and minimal. Lighting effects are in full effect to make it a bit more intreasting. My home network runs on an old Dell Inspiron box, running <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFSense</a>. I also tend to have a cup of coffee on my desk at all times, because who doesn't run on coffee.</p>
<h2>Office Setup</h2>
<h3><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP731?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27&quot; 5K iMac, 4.0ghz i7 quad-core, 32gb of memory (Late 2015)</a></h3>
<p>This is my main rig at the moment. I do all of my work on this desktop, there just isn't anything like having something all built in and taking less space. I did at one time have a Macbook Pro late 2015; though this was given away to my cousin who was starting school and needed a good laptop.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2715Q-27-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00PC9HFO8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27&quot; Dell Ultra HD 4k Monitor P2715Q</a></h3>
<p>Having another monitor is just a must-have for me. Even though I use the multiple workspaces, just having that extra screen to offload any of the extra things that I just don't need to fret about has been great. Music in the background would be an astonishing example, just push it on over to the other screen. This gives me the music, and out of the way view; though it still enables me to swiftly glance over and see what's playing if it is something that was played randomly.</p>
<h3><a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drop CTRL Mechanical Keyboard - Gateron MX Brown Switches</a></h3>
<p>I spend a lot of time typing on a keyboard; it should feel great, and not bothersome to the other people in my house. The CTRL is a tenkeyless board (with hot-swappable switches), which previously I had Cherry MX Blues installed, they were just a bit too clicky and loud for my liking at home. I did install some, Pro Rings 70A, 1.5mm silicone o-rings; which reduced the sound from the blues a bit, but it was still there for the most part. My escape key is none other than the Specter - Cross Eyes Special - Madness / Transparent (Hot Keys Project), which I have to say just adds to the keyboard.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Trackpad 2 - Silver</a></h3>
<p>The Magic Trackpad 2 is exceptional, it allows me to charge it and use it at the same time. This is pretty much my goto when it comes to using a mouse. Notably when dealing with gestures, over the Magic Mouse 2; while I have one, it just feels too small and slow-moving. Don't get me wrong, the Magic Trackpad suffers the same fate of slow-moving, however, with Mouse Acceleration, by Christian Zuckschwerdt, it is better than the mouse itself in my opinion. It just has more space to do the gestures.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-model-o-white" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glorious Model O (Matte White) Mouse</a></h3>
<p>There are times that I just want to reach for a mouse and go, these times I reach for the astounding Model O, yes yes, I know... Except it's a gaming mouse, this is true, but it also handles being a daily driver for someone who loves to use a high DPI mouse and it is lightweight and just has an amazing experience using it.</p>
<h2>Terminal &amp; Code Editor / Development</h2>
<h3><a href="https://hyper.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyper Terminal</a></h3>
<p>When you spend most of your time in the terminal, when not coding, having a gorgeous and effective terminal is going to be essential. I choose Hyper Terminal, not only is it elegant, functional, but also allows plugins, it just works. I must admit, I have and always will be a fan of iTerm2. Though there is something with hyper that always draws me back to it...</p>
<p>Here are some of my settings for Hyper, starting with the plugins I reach for; hypercwd, gitrocket (This simply adds a bit more fun to the terminal when you deploy using git), hyper-statusline, hyper-quit, hyper-border, hyper-opacity, hyper-font-ligatures. The theme that I'm using is hyper-ayu, with the spaceship prompt. I also keep hyper on the canary build and use the font, Meslo LG M DZ for Powerline. My shell of choice is ZSH, using OhMyZsh and starship prompt, colorls and zsh-syntax-highlighting.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sublime Text 3</a></h3>
<p>Sublime Text 3 has been my goto editor, but lately, it just feels like it is coming up short. I will still use it from time to time when there is only a simple edit here and there that needs to be updated.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHPStorm</a></h3>
<p>When working on a Laravel project or anything PHP, PHPStorm is my goto and must-have editor. I will say that I have always been a fan of the darker editing styles, though after watching an outstanding video by, Brendt. This has changed my mind. I use the Photon - Light theme, which just so happens to also be made by, Brendt. My font choice is Dank Mono, at a size of 12, and line-height of 1.5.</p>
<h3><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a></h3>
<p>I normally pull out VSCode when I'm working on another project. Like this website, I built it using Gridsome, a Vuejs framework, and VSCode just felt like the better option for me in this case. Just like in PHPStorm, I'm running Photon - Light theme, font choice again is Dank Mono, font size 12, and line-height 1.6.</p>
<h3><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laravel Valet</a></h3>
<p>Truth be told, I'm not into setting up NGINX, PHP, etc; more so than anything on a local development setup. For this I summon Laravel Valet which takes care of everything for me, it's fast and easy to get installed and running. It has truly been a lifesaver of time. It allows me to share some of the work I'm working on also, though I have to switch back to iTerm2 to use the &quot;valet share&quot; command.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a></h3>
<p>Docker comes in handy when I need to grab a certain version of MySQL, or even spin up a Redis container. I don't install MySQL locally so to say, I use docker and make it so that I can access it with Laravel valet. Which makes switching versions and testing painless.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfred</a></h3>
<p>Alfred is like Apple's spotlight, but on roids. Simply put, if you don't want to touch your mouse and still move around, Alfred will get the job done. With Workflows, it makes it just that much more robust. Seriously, it's like having a Mac Genie in your OSX. Some of the Workflows that I use, JetBrians - Open Project, Kill Process, Laravel Docs, Naming things, PHP Docs, TablePlus, TailwindCSS Docs, Trash Downloads</p>
<h3><a href="https://tinkerwell.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tinkerwell</a></h3>
<p>Tinkerwell, is Laravel tinker on roids, and simply magical. Carefully crafted by Marcel Pociot and Sebastian Schlein at Beyond Code. It's honestly a pleasure to work with and use, and at $14.99 a license, you can't go wrong. I urge anyone that hasn't tried it yet, to give it a whirl.</p>
<h3><a href="https://tableplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tableplus</a></h3>
<p>TablePlus, by all means, was not my first choice in MySQL remote management, or even dealing with the local docker MySQL containers. I was an advent user of SequelPro, but lack of development from that team made me just like all other developers that work with MySQL, look for an alternative option. Thus, TablePlus was found; honestly, this thing is a beast and even allows me to connect to the Redis server, though I will admit, I'm still working on getting used to its workflow.</p>
<p>I will be honest, I still have high hopes for SequelPro and do wish them the best and getting back on track of the active development train. Even if that means that someone has to fork it and take over it!</p>
<h3><a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweetbot</a></h3>
<p>Let's be honest, there isn't any escape from the entrapment of social media. Between, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and even Instagram by Facebook, I'm sure you use one, or all of them. Personally, I have a Facebook account, but it's really just for close friends and family. Twitter is where you can find me and connect, in which case I use Tweetbot as my twitter client of choice.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sipapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sip</a></h3>
<p>Have you ever saw and fell head over heels of a color on a website or even in an application? I mean, fell head over heels may be too strong of a saying, but you know where I'm coming from. When I have that urge to know exactly what color code something is, my tool of the trade is Sip. It allows me to grab the color code of the color I want and keep on moving.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bartender 3</a></h3>
<p>Ever used someone else's Mac or iMac, and just look at that menu bar and say, woah! Why do you have all these icons up here, it's simply a mess! Yah, that's me, but luckily bartender helps fight that, and keeps them organized and hidden so that I can keep my menu bar looking exceptional.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macdown</a></h3>
<p>Macdown is an app that comes in handy when you want to write some markdown, and you are one of those people that visually have to see it before you do anything else. On the left, you write your Markdown, and on the right, you see it right before your eyes, just like that. Using this saves my bacon many times for sure.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a></h3>
<p>Firefox is my choice of browser, this is my daily runner and driver. I use to use Chrome heavily, but with the latest updates to Firefox, it just makes no sense but to go back to the roots and use Firefox once again. I do, however, use Vivaldi from time to time, and also Chrome to test things out, and ensure all is working as it should.</p>
<h2>Productivity &amp; Communication</h2>
<h3><a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynalist</a></h3>
<p>At times I start with an idea, and well... Let's be honest, I can't say that I've been any good ever at remembering things. When I have an idea for something, Dynalist is my goto app, and also my todo list. Because, well you know if you are married your wife always has a todo list for you. 😓 🤣</p>
<h3><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fantastical 2</a></h3>
<p>Dates, who can remember them? I'm not good at dates, if it isn't set as a reminder on my phone or computer, I will honestly just forget about it completely. This is why I always reach for Fantastical 2, it is simply amazing, simple and elegant.</p>
<h3><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to communicating in a team, slack is there. With the options of creating rooms, or even DMing that one person that you have to speak with. I love that you can set statuses, etc. Reminds me almost of the days back with Yahoo Messenger, and MSN messenger.</p>
<h3><a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a></h3>
<p>I normally jump into discord to speak to a few select people, though I'm also in a room with a bunch of other developers, who share code, their findings and things like that. However, for the most part, it is just used to blow off some steam and boot up into windows and play some games here and there. (Though the truth is, I hear TailwindCSS is on discord!)</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mailbutler.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Mail + Mailbutler</a></h3>
<p>Mail is just one of those things, you either love or hate it, or simply put you just deal with it. The default mail client is what I use, and spice it up with Mailbutler to give me a bit more options to my nest. All my domain emails are all routed through Zoho Mail, which isn't free anymore. Previously, I used Airmail, while it was great it was just a bit too much, and I honestly rather not spend that much time in an outdated communication system.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to hosting static websites much like the one that you're reading this on. Netlify is my goto web hosting provider. Their free tier is more than enough to continue building and publishing every month. If you haven't checked them out yet, you should; I can almost 100% say, you won't regret it!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7224765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vultr</a></h3>
<p>When I need to spin up a VPS container, or anything that is going to take some power. Vultr is my goto provider. In the past, I've used Digital Ocean and also Linode, nothing wrong with them honestly, however, Vultr just has an amazing UI to work with, and honest pricing for respectable specs. <em>(<strong>Heads up, if you click on this link, it is an affiliate link where I will get a kickback if you sign up.</strong>)</em></p>
<h3><a href="https://hover.com/DaqGCbtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a></h3>
<p>Hover, is where I register all of my domains. I know they are a Tucows reseller, and they are a bit more expensive than other providers. However, their support, and using their website just feels right and is worth every penny more than you have to pay for a domain with another provider. <em>(<strong>Heads up, if you click on this link, it is an affiliate link where I will get a kickback if you sign up.</strong>)</em></p></div>
