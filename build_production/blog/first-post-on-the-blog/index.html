        <div class="mb-12 pb-4" v-pre>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jason! Welcome to my first blog post.</p>
            <p>Recently, blogs have become a high source and wealth of information. I craved to jump on this and provide
                the resources of information. That I have also come across and experienced. Within PHP, MySQL,
                Applications that I use, and how I am not a boss but a leader for the organization I work for. </p>
            <p>So, welcome to my brand-new website. I intend on blogging about programming, life; and what else may come
                to mind. </p>
            <p>I also want to write about what I've learned from the Laravel community. I'm also establishing a place to
                allow me to provide and yield tutorial life posts.</p>
            <p>So if you're ready; we will go ahead and dive into it. I wanted to start my first post by providing
                information on what I made the website on.</p>
            <p>I also figured that it was a good time to give readers that will visit my site, a bit more information
                about me. It allows you to know who is behind the scenes and writing these blog posts.</p>
            <p>Though that is always the troublesome part right... What should I start with? I guess I will present a
                bit more information about myself so that you know who is writing these blog posts.</p>
            <h3>A Bit More About Jason</h3>
            <p>I'm an uncomplicated man that appreciates learning new things and teaching. I live in <strong>Newport
                News, Virginia</strong>. With my beautiful wife, who happens to also run her own business. <a
                    href="https://preciousmemories.photography" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PreciousMemories
                Photography</a>.</p>
            <p>Running the business with her has been an eye-opening adventure! I didn't understand how much work is
                involved in trying to create and run a business.</p>
            <p>Between the two of us, we have 6 kids together. I have 3 girls, and 2 boys, that I couldn't be more proud
                of. I'm also a <em>stepfather</em> of her son but at the end of the day... </p>
            <p>Do we need to put <em>stepfather</em> into something? I have always thought that blood doesn't define
                your family. The love and connection that you have with each other.</p>
            <h3>The Road to Static Site Generators that Didn't Work Out.</h3>
            <p>Okay, okay, I get it you are ready for the nuts and bolts that run this website. Well, I started off
                coding the website in a variety of things. One of which I started to write it in was <a
                        href="https://laravel.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Laravel</a>. It is a PHP framework
                that I completely enjoy, and want to use it on every project. </p>
            <p>Though of course, we all know that each project/site has its requirements. Building it with <a
                    href="https://laravel.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Laravel</a> was completely going to be
                overkill. </p>
            <p>I didn't want to use WordPress. It's a good firm blogging platform, though their vision has gone away
                from being just that. A blogging platform to a full-blown CMS.</p>
            <p>It tries too hard to be a CMS, and honestly, the core isn't too bad? (joke attended) The issue is plugins
                and themes that you can get for it. Neglecting to patch things, and always trying to keep plugins/themes
                updated.</p>
            <p>People also tend to overdo it with the plugins, making their website slow. (Not that WordPress by default
                isn't slow already...) I wanted something that was going to be fast, simple and easy to update.</p>
            <p>Static sites here I come! So I went on the look for finding the most suitable static site generator that
                I could find. Though we know this is a user preference. </p>
            <p>I started working with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, it
                was solid and felt great. I was also using Contentful as the backend after I found a post on <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@ryanwiemer/gatsby-and-the-jam-stack-91e31508f364" rel="noopener"
                        target="_blank">Medium</a> from <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanwiemer" rel="noopener"
                                                          target="_blank">Ryan Wiemer</a>.</p>
            <p>After a couple of weeks of development; it just felt <strong>overly-complicated</strong>... I thought
                about maintenance, do I want to rely that much on javascript? </p>
            <p>Well, I then found <a href="https://gridsome.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gridsome</a>, <em>yes
                okay I know it is also javascript and built using <strong>Vuejs</strong> rather than
                <strong>Reactjs</strong>.</em></p>
            <p>So I started playing with <a href="https://gridsome.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gridsome</a>,
                and naturally, to be quite straightforward I truly <strong>preferred</strong> it over
                <strong>Gatsby</strong>. </p>
            <p>It was more of something that I knew and was familiar with. After all, I come from the Laravel community
                where <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vuejs</a> is a prominent player. </p>
            <p>Everything was coming together, and I completed and launched the site with Netlify. Though after a while
                it still felt like something was yearning or I was <strong>overdoing</strong> it with
                <em>javascript</em>. So I had begun the hunt once again for something that may work out better.</p>
            <h3>Jigsaw by TightenCo That Lead a Clear Path</h3>
            <p>I ultimately came across and settled on <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co/" rel="noopener"
                                                          target="_blank">Jigsaw</a>, by TigtenCo. Truly, I couldn't be
                more satisfied with how things worked out. They have a marvelous <a
                        href="https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-blog-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog
                    template</a> to start from. Which is being used right now with just edits to make it my style, on
                this very website! </p>
            <p>All the blog posts are all done and wrote in Markdown, heck even my <a href="https://jasonkenyon.me/uses"
                                                                                      rel="noopener" target="_blank">uses</a>
                page is done in Markdown! Which is just exceptional and robust enough so that I don't have to write a
                single line more of HTML. </p>
            <p>The CSS framework used is none other than <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="noopener"
                                                            target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>. Which if you have not heard
                of it, or even tried it. I can't encourage you enough to, just stop reading this and try it out! It is
                an astounding CSS framework. </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Tailwind is different.</p>
                <p>Instead of opinionated predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let
                    you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Though if I have to be realistic about what I prefer the greatest about <strong>Jigsaw</strong>; it would
                have to boil down to just being able to use <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade"
                                                               rel="noopener" target="_blank">Laravel's blade</a>
                templating. </p>
            <p>With the duo pack that is running now, I just feel overly satisfied with how things have come together. I
                will honestly continue to use <strong>Jigsaw</strong>. It is just dead simple, and easy to use and makes
                making static websites a breeze.</p>
            <p>Overall, I'm still learning more and more about <strong>Jigsaw</strong>. I will continue to blog about my
                adventure with it and post new updates on things that I'm working on. Any releases or new information
                that I think everyone will enjoy.</p>
            <p>Until next time, have a good day/week, and stay searching, learning and getting it!</p></div>
