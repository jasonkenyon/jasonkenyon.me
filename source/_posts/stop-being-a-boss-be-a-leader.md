### Being a Leader is Better Than a Boss

So wait, you are saying that I shouldn't be a boss? What do you even mean by this? Being a leader is being a boss but with diverse leadership practices. 

You aren't bossing or commanding, neither pointing fingers. A boss uses words such as I, me, myself... 

A leader will use words such as we, us. A boss will have issues with keeping people under them. Where a leader will have people stay, thrive, gain respect for those below them. 

> #### Employees don't drop companies they leave managers/supervisors.

### Why You Should Strive To Be a Leader

Being a leader is so much more influential than being a boss! You challenge yourself to teach, encourage, guide people out of their comfort zone. You take the time to develop them and offer a helping hand when things get rocky. A boss is someone that will push paper and do what is best for them, moreover not necessarily what is suitable for the morale of the company. 

Is being a boss a bad thing? This depends on how you take your power of being a boss. While I'm a supervisor, I'm the supervisor of various people under me. However, I don't relate to myself as their boss but as their leader. 

You see each person that is under me is someone! That someone has vulnerabilities and strengths. It is my responsibility to discover these vulnerabilities and strengths. Help them grow as a person, and as an employee within the organization. 

At the end, when you are a leader you are guaranteeing that the company will be thriving because more people will stay. People don't get frustrated by the company, they get weary of their bosses, and how they get treated. 

What prompted me to even write this post. Was a inspring YouTube video, the video creator makes a great point and asks a great question.

> #### Sir, ask yourself this question... Have you ever heard of a "World Boss"?

I recommend anyone that is reading this to take the time and watch the video. The message in the video is powerful, encouraging.

Something that we as leaders or even employees should follow. You can find that video at **[Boss vs Employee (2020) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrVNTZ6ORm8)**

### Dealing with Performance Management

So, this will bring the subjects of so we shouldn't issue performance administration. Furthermore, be our employees' friends. The answer to this is simple!

 Performance management is in place to provide that feedback to the employee. To coach and develop them. An employee will thrive for feedback if provided with care.

As a leader, you have to find the balance of providing it. By the time performance management is needed. The employee should know what you have done to help them.

They will also see and understand that performance management is coming. As you took the time to develop and extend a hand to help them out.
