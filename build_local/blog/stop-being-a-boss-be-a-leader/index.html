          <h3>Being a Leader is Better Than a Boss</h3>
          <p>
            So wait, you are saying that I shouldn't be a boss? What do you even
            mean by this? Being a leader is being a boss but with diverse
            leadership practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            You aren't bossing or commanding, neither pointing fingers. A boss
            uses words such as I, me, myself...
          </p>
          <p>
            A leader will use words such as we, us. A boss will have issues with
            keeping people under them. Where a leader will have people stay,
            thrive, gain respect for those below them.
          </p>

            </h4>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Why You Should Strive To Be a Leader</h3>
          <p>
            Being a leader is so much more influential than being a boss! You
            challenge yourself to teach, encourage, guide people out of their
            comfort zone. You take the time to develop them and offer a helping
            hand when things get rocky. A boss is someone that will push paper
            and do what is best for them, moreover not necessarily what is
            suitable for the morale of the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is being a boss a bad thing? This depends on how you take your power
            of being a boss. While I'm a supervisor, I'm the supervisor of
            various people under me. However, I don't relate to myself as their
            boss but as their leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see each person that is under me is someone! That someone has
            vulnerabilities and strengths. It is my responsibility to discover
            these vulnerabilities and strengths. Help them grow as a person, and
            as an employee within the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, when you are a leader you are guaranteeing that the
            company will be thriving because more people will stay. People don't
            get frustrated by the company, they get weary of their bosses, and
            how they get treated.
          </p>

            What prompted me to even write this post. Was a inspring YouTube
            video, the video creator makes a great point and asks a great
            question.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <h4>
              Sir, ask yourself this question... Have you ever heard of a
              &quot;World Boss&quot;?
            </h4>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I recommend anyone that is reading this to take the time and watch
            the video. The message in the video is powerful, encouraging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something that we as leaders or even employees should follow. You

          <h3>Dealing with Performance Management</h3>
          <p>
            So, this will bring the subjects of so we shouldn't issue
            performance administration. Furthermore, be our employees' friends.
            The answer to this is simple!
          </p>
          <p>
            Performance management is in place to provide that feedback to the
            employee. To coach and develop them. An employee will thrive for
            feedback if provided with care.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a leader, you have to find the balance of providing it. By the
            time performance management is needed. The employee should know what
            you have done to help them.
          </p>
          <p>
            They will also see and understand that performance management is
            coming. As you took the time to develop and extend a hand to help
            them out.
