          <p>Hi, I'm Jason! Welcome to my first blog post.</p>
          <p>
            Recently, blogs have become a great source and an abundance of
            knowledge. I wanted to present the sources of information that I
            have also come across and experienced.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, welcome to my brand-new website; I intend on blogging about
            programming, life, and what else may come to mind. I also want to
            write about what I've learned from the Laravel community. I'm also
            establishing a place to allow me to provide and yield tutorials, and
            overall a database of information I can look back on.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you're ready, we will go ahead and dive into it. I wanted to
            start my first post by providing information on what I made the
            website on. I also thought that it was a great time to give readers
            that will visit my site, a bit more information about me. It allows
            you to know who is behind the scenes and writing these blog posts.
            Though that is always the troublesome part right... What should I
            start with? I guess I will present a bit more information about
            myself so that you know who is writing these blog posts.
          </p>
          <h3>A Bit More About Jason</h3>
          <p>
            I'm an uncomplicated man that enjoys learning new things and
            teaching. I live in <strong>Newport News, Virginia</strong>. With my
            beautiful wife, who happens to also run her own business,
            <a
              href="https://preciousmemories.photography"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >PreciousMemories Photography</a
            >. Running a business with her has been an eye-opening adventure! I
            didn't understand how much work is involved in trying to create and
            run a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between the two of us, we have 6 kids together; I have three girls
            and two boys that I couldn't be more delighted about. I'm also a
            stepfather of her son but at the end of the day... Do we need to put
            stepfather into something? I have always thought that blood doesn't
            define your family. The love and connection that you have with each
            other.
          </p>
          <h3>The Road to Static Site Generators that Didn't Work Out.</h3>
          <p>
            Okay, okay I get it you are ready for the nuts and bolts that run
            this website. Well, I began making the website in a mixture of
            things. One of which I began to write it in was Laravel. It's a PHP
            framework that I absolutely appreciate, and want to use it on all
            projects. Though, of course, we all know that each project has its
            own requirements. Building it with
            <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Laravel</a
            >
            was sequentially going to be overkill.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't want to use WordPress. It's a good firm blogging platform,
            though their vision has gone away from being just that. A blogging
            platform to a full-blown CMS. It tries too hard to be a CMS, and
            genuinely, the core isn't too bad? (pun intended) The issue is
            plugins and themes that you can get for it. Neglecting to patch
            things, and always trying to keep plugins/themes updated. People
            also tend to overdo it with plugins making their website slow. Not
            that WordPress by default isn't slow already... I wanted something
            that was going to be fast, simple, and easy to update.
          </p>
          <p>
            Static sites here I come! So I went on the look for finding the most
            suitable static site generator that I could find. Though we know
            this is a user preference.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started working with
            <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Gatsby</a
            >, it was solid and felt great. I was also using Contentful as the
            backend after I found a post on
            <a
              href="https://medium.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-and-the-jam-stack-91e31508f364"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >Medium</a
            >
            from Ryan Wiemer. After a couple of weeks of development. It just
            felt <strong>overly-complicated</strong>... I thought about
            maintenance, do I want to rely that much on javascript?
          </p>
          <p>
            I then found
            <a href="https://gridsome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Gridsome</a
            >,
            <em
              >yes, okay I know it's also javascript and built using
              <strong>Vuejs</strong> rather than <strong>Reactjs</strong>.</em
            >
            So, I started playing with Gridsome, and naturally, to be quite
            outspoken, I truly <em>valued</em> it over Gatsby. It was something
            that I knew and was familiar with. After all, I come from the
            Laravel community, where Vuejs is a notable player.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything was coming together, and I completed and launched the
            site with Netlify. Though, after a while, it still felt like
            something was yearning, or I was <strong>overloading</strong> it
            with <em>javascript</em>. So I had begun the hunt once again for
            something that may work out better.
          </p>
          <h3>Jigsaw by TightenCo That Lead a Clear Path</h3>
          <p>
            I eventually came across and settled on
            <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Jigsaw</a
            >, by TigtenCo. Accurately, I couldn't be more fulfilled with how
            things worked out. They have an astonishing
            <a
              href="https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-blog-template"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >blog template</a
            >
            to start from. Which is being used right now with just edits to make
            it my style, on this very website!
          </p>
          <p>
            All the blog posts are all done and wrote in Markdown, heck even my
            <a href="https://jasonkenyon.me/uses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >uses</a
            >
            page is done in Markdown! Which is just exceptional and robust
            enough so that I don't have to write a single line more of HTML. The
            CSS framework used is none other than
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >TailwindCSS</a
            >. Which if you have not heard of it, or even tried it. I can't
            encourage you enough to, just stop reading this and try it out! It
            is an astounding CSS framework.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Tailwind is different.</p>
            <p>
              Instead of unreasonable predesigned components, Tailwind provides
              low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom
              designs without ever leaving your HTML.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Though, if I ought to be genuine about what I prefer the most
            notable about <strong>Jigsaw</strong>, it would come down to just
            being able to use
            <a
              href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >Laravel's blade</a
            >
            templating. With the duo pack that is running now, I just feel
            overly satisfied with how things have come together. I will
            genuinely continue to use Jigsaw. It is just dead simple and easy to
            use and makes making static websites an easy task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I'm still learning more and more about
            <strong>Jigsaw</strong>. I will continue to blog about my experience
            with it and post new updates on things that I'm working on. Any
            releases or new erudition that I think everyone will enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>Until next time, stay searching and learning, and getting it!</p>
